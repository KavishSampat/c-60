  <p id="wif"> Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. ... Since at least the 15th century, chess has been known as the “royal game” because of its popularity among the nobility. It improves your thinking abilities and if you dont like sports like cricket and football you can play chess. I like playing football but i still play chess.</p>
